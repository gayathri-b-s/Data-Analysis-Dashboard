# Data-Analysis-Dashboard (Interactive Healthcare Dashboard Using Excel,PowerBI and Tableu)

## Project Objective
To leverage healthcare data analysis to uncover trends in patient outcomes, disease patterns, and resource utilization, enabling hospitals and healthcare organizations to make informed, evidence-based decisions.

## Questions (KPIs)

•	What is the total number of patients?

•	What is the total number of laboratory tests conducted?

•	What is the average age of patients?

•	What percentage of laboratory test results are abnormal?

•	What is the follow-up visit rate?

•	What are the top five diagnosed medical conditions?

•	Who are the top five doctors based on years of experience?

•	How many doctors are available in each medical specialty?

•	How are treatment types distributed across patients?

•	How are patients distributed among doctors?

•	How are visit types distributed?

•	Dashboard Interaction

## Process

•	Verified the dataset for duplicate records and missing values, and resolved identified data quality issues.

•	Ensured data consistency and cleanliness by validating data types, formats, and standardized value entries.

•	Created pivot tables based on key performance indicators (KPIs) to support analytical insights.

•	Consolidated all pivot tables into a single interactive Excel dashboard, applying slicers to enable dynamic filtering.

•	Imported the same dataset into Power BI and developed an enhanced dashboard using DAX measures and advanced visualizations.

•	Implemented advanced analytical features in Tableau, including calculated fields, parameters, filters, and slicers for deeper insights.

## Project Insight

•	The healthcare system manages 10,000 patients with 1,000 doctors, resulting in an average workload of 10 patients per doctor, indicating balanced resource utilization.

•	The follow-up rate of 49.84% shows that nearly half of the patients return for continued care, reflecting moderate patient engagement.

•	Around 33.54% of laboratory test results are abnormal, highlighting a significant volume of cases requiring medical attention and follow-up.

•	Asthma, Diabetes, Hypertension, Migraine, and general health checkups are the most frequently diagnosed conditions, each contributing almost equally to the overall case load.

•	The average treatment cost is 524.75, serving as a useful benchmark for cost analysis and financial planning.

•	Treatment outcomes across medication, surgery, vaccination, and physical therapy show a relatively even distribution among completed, ongoing, and discontinued statuses.

•	General Medicine and Cardiology have the highest number of doctors, ensuring adequate coverage for common and chronic conditions.

•	The most experienced doctors have 49 to 66 years of experience, indicating strong senior expertise within the organization.

•	Visit types such as emergency, follow-up, routine checkups, and specialist consultations display a balanced distribution across completed, scheduled, and cancelled visits.

•	Texas, California, and Florida account for the highest number of insurance providers, suggesting stronger insurance penetration or higher patient volumes in these states.

## Final Conclusion

This healthcare analytics project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support better clinical and operational decision-making. By integrating and analyzing patient demographics, doctor availability, treatment patterns, laboratory outcomes, and visit behaviors, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of healthcare performance. The analysis highlights balanced doctor workloads, a significant proportion of abnormal lab results requiring follow-up, and consistent treatment completion trends across care types. Overall, the project showcases effective use of Excel, Power BI, and Tableau to transform raw healthcare data into meaningful insights, enabling stakeholders to improve patient care, optimize resources, and enhance operational efficiency.

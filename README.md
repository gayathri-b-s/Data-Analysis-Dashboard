# Data-Analysis-Dashboard (Interactive Healthcare Dashboard Using Excel,PowerBI and Tableu)

## Project Objective
To leverage healthcare data analysis to uncover trends in patient outcomes, disease patterns, and resource utilization, enabling hospitals and healthcare organizations to make informed, evidence-based decisions.

## Questions (KPIs)

•	What is the total number of patients?

•	What is the total number of laboratory tests conducted?

•	What is the average age of patients?

•	What percentage of laboratory test results are abnormal?

•	What is the follow-up visit rate?

•	What are the top five diagnosed medical conditions?

•	Who are the top five doctors based on years of experience?

•	How many doctors are available in each medical specialty?

•	How are treatment types distributed across patients?

•	How are patients distributed among doctors?

•	How are visit types distributed?

•	Dashboard Interaction

## Process

•	Verified the dataset for duplicate records and missing values, and resolved identified data quality issues.

•	Ensured data consistency and cleanliness by validating data types, formats, and standardized value entries.

•	Created pivot tables based on key performance indicators (KPIs) to support analytical insights.

•	Consolidated all pivot tables into a single interactive Excel dashboard, applying slicers to enable dynamic filtering.

•	Imported the same dataset into Power BI and developed an enhanced dashboard using DAX measures and advanced visualizations.

•	Implemented advanced analytical features in Tableau, including calculated fields, parameters, filters, and slicers for deeper insights.
